# Median-Test
Median Test in R Software

As we know, in R software there are several functions that can be used to carry out non-parametric tests such as: sign test, Mann-Whitney, Kolmogorov, Kruskal Wallis, but not the median test.

In this project I can describe the Median Test manual function for non-parameteric tests in R software. I also hope that this manual function can be taken over by R Software companies to be used as a direct function in R software
